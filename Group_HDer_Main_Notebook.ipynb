    "# Introduction and Data Source\n",
    "### Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "Sentiment analysis from text is done in order to identify subjective information in it and understand the opinions, feelings, and sentiments emanating from the text. (definition from https://www.repustate.com/blog/text-sentiment-analysis/)  \n",
    "Sentiment analysis is very necessary. It can allow companies to understand the voice of users, improve products in time, and even guide product development to help companies develop better.  \n",
    "### Problem Statement and Data Source of our Project\n",
    "In our project, we do sentiment analysis from Amazon Reviews. You could find the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews    \n",
    "The dataset contains a training set and a testing set, each is in bz2 format. The training set contains 3,600,000 records, and the testing set contains 400,000 records.  \n",
    "Each records in both datasets consists of a label and a review.  \n",
    "The label is either `__label__1` or `__label__2`. A review after `__label__1` is a 1- or 2-star review, which is a negative review. A review after `__label__2` is a 4- or 5-star review, which is a positive review. There are no neutral reviews (i.e. 3-star reviews) in this dataset.  \n",
    "### Purpose of our Project\n",
    "Our project aims to learn reviews and labels in the training set of Amazon Reviews dataset, and then predict labels of unseen reviews in the testing set; this turns our problem to a binary classification problem. From sentiment analysis view, our project aims to learn sentiments of reviews in the training set, and analyze sentiments of unseen reviews in testing set."

I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^\n",
      "\n",
      "__label__2 The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "__label__2 Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "__label__2 Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross\n",
      "\n",
      "__label__2 Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.\n",

A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing \"Who was that singing ?\"\n",

      "__label__2 One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.\n",

However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.\n",

I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's.

    "### What is Word2Vec and why use it\n",
    "Since computer could only read numerical values, so we need to change words into numerical values. There are many ways to do this, like one-hot encoding and bag of words. We choose to use word vectors, because word vectors not only change words into numerial vectors, but also make words with similar sentiments closer to each other in the word vector space. This will be very helpful to our sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "# How to build Word2Vec using own data\n",
    "The idea to build word vectors is that words with similar contexts have similar sentiment.  \n",
    "There are 2 popular methods to build word vectors, the first is **CBOW** (continuous bag of words), which use given contexts to predict the word in the center, and the other is **Skip-gram**, which use the given center word to predict contexts. In this project, word vectors are built by feeding training reviews to the Skip-gram model using the Word2Vec in the genism module.   \n",
    "When training **Skip-gram**, we feed two words to the Skip-gram model and tell it they are neighbours. When testing the model, we also feed two words to it and ask it: what is the probability that they are neighbours. Therefore, we need negative sampling or the model will always answer one. Which means, we training the model, we need pairs of words that are neighbours, and we also need to make pairs of words that could not be neighbours, and feed them to the model.  \n",

    " \n",
    "Traditionally, the CNN model is used for image processing and analysis, but recently, CNN has been used in the NLP field widely. As the image is 2-dimensional. Different from images, the text is 1-dimensional, so the first thing in building the model is to visualize the texts to 2-dimensional by converting the words into word embeddings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I implement the model with 1-dimensional convolution layers, where the embedding dimension is the depth of the filter and the number of tokens in the sentences is the width.   \n",
    "**Convolutional Layers:**  \n",
    "In this model, I implement the convolutional layers with Conv1D. The in_channels argument is the number of \"channels\" in the image (or word) going into the convolutional layer. Different from images, when using text, there is only a single channel, the text itself. The out_channels is the number of filters and the kernel_size is the size of the filters. Each of our kernel_sizes is going to be [n x emb_dim] where 𝑛 is the size of the n-grams. Then pass the tensors through the convolutional and pooling layers, using the ReLU activation function (σ(x)=max⁡\\{ 0,x}) after the convolutional layers.  \n",
    "**Pooling Layers:**\n",
    "Another important layer is the pooling layer on the output of the convolutional layers. In this model, I choose to use max pooling instead of average pooling, which means, the previous layer is divided into small groups of units and the maximum activation among each small group of units is copied to a single unit in the subsequent layer.  \n",
    "**Regularization layer (Dropout Layer):**  \n",
    "The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1-rate) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged.\n",
    "**Hyperparameter choosing:**  \n",
    "Initially, I set epoch=10 to train the model, from the plot shows that after the 4th epoch, the valid accuracy is getting lower than the training accuracy while the training accuracy keeps increasing. If the number of epochs increases, this may result in overfitting, so I decrease the epochs to 4  \n",

    "## Model 2: Long short term memory -- LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM is a special kind of RNN and is able to learn long range dependencies using a combination of forget, input and output gates.\n",
    "In the first step, the forget gate is used to determine what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. It puts ht-1 and xt through a sigmoid function and outputs a number through 0 and 1 for each value in the cell state Ct-1. The value of 1 means keeping the information, while 0 stands for forgetting.\n",
    "Then the input gate is used to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This part consists of two parts. Firstly, the input gate layer will decide which parts will be updated by sigmoid. Next, the tanh layer will create update values. After that, we combine the two parts and update to the cell sate.\n",
    "Finally, the output gate will decide what we’re going to output. First, we use a sigmoid layer to decide which part of the cell state will be output. Then we multiply the cell state after passing tanh with the output of the sigmoid gate. \n",
    "In the implementation of the code, we changed the hyperparameters, the number of epochs and the batch size, to find the best LSTM model. When the epoch is 4 and batch size is 200, we get the highest accuracy 92.388% in the test set. \n",

    "The GRU model is a variant of LSTM with only two gates in the model, the reset gate and the update gate. In the case of hyperparameter tuning, the performance of GRU and LSTM is comparable, but the training samples are less, the training time is faster, and the structure is simpler. The above three figures are the forward propagation formula of GRU. Update gate Zt: used to control the degree to which the state information of the previous moment is brought into the current state. The larger the value, the more the state information of the previous moment is brought in. Multiply the information of the previous moment and the current moment to the right by the weight matrix and add them, and then digitize them to [0, 1] through the sigmoid function and then send them to the update gate. Reset gate Rt: Control how much historical information there is in the previous state It is written to the current candidate set h~t. The smaller the reset gate, the less information of the previous state is written. It is the same as the data processing of the update gate, but the value and use of the weight matrix are different.\n"

    "# Discussion and Future Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion of CNN\n",
    "From the confusion matrix and classification report, it shows that the data set is balanced, so it can achieve high accuracy. On the other hand, if the data set is imbalanced, we may use much data to train the model.\n",
    "In this task, I manually choose the parameters to find the best model, and in the future, I can use cross validation such as k-fold for hyper-parameters tuning, which will be more effective and more correct.\n",
    "Furthermore, I can try to use keras and tensorflow to build the model, which is different from pytorch, but is also effective in machine learning and deep learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion of LSTM\n",
    "From the above classfication report and confusion matrix, it is obvious that micro and macro metircs are quite close, so this is a balance dataset.The original accuracy is 92.388%. But after all work have done, we changed the dropout from 0.5 to 0.2 to get a more optimal model. The accuracy of the new model is 94.15%, which is higher than 92.388%. This is probobaly beacuse the high dropout caused some information loss and LSTM failed to predict correctly. During the hyperparamter tuning, I changed the number of epochs and batch size manullay, the accuracy was always around 90% and it took 30 minutes to run each epoch. So there are still more I can improve in the future, I may use RandomSearchCV function to find much better parameters for LSTM model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion of GRU\n",
    "As can be seen from the confusion matrix and classification report, the dataset is balanced, so high accuracy can be achieved.The accuracy rate of the model is close to 95%. In this model, the hidden layer dimension and dropout of the model, the number of GRU layers, and the learning rate are all manually adjusted by me, which does not mean that the current parameters are the GRU model. In the future, I will use the cross-validation method to adjust the optimal hyperparameters of the model to obtain the best performance of the model. When comparing with LSTM model, GRU model runs faster than LSTM model due to its simple parameters. But the model behaves pretty much the same. When both of them are optimal in terms of specific tasks and parameters, their performance is similar. But for this project, the accuracy of GRU model is slightly higher than that of LSTM. Therefore, we choose the GRU model as the final model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Discussion\n",
    "We could see from the table of results, all of these 3 models reached test accuracy of 94%, which is really a nice performance. The GRU model performs slightly better. We tried several times  without changing parameters and hyperparameters, the GRU model always have the highest accuracy. Therefore, we finally decide to use the GRU model.  \n",
    "In this project, we used three models for comparison, which can not only consolidate knowledge, but also compare which model is more suitable for this project.   \n",
    "In future work, we can optimize the model by adjusting the parameters, such as adjusting the dropout value in the LSTM model, adding cross-validation to the CNN model to find the optimal parameters, and increasing the amount of data. After all, our project only uses half of the dataset."
